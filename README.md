# Swedish-Fish-market-research

Problem by Rasmus Bååth, adapted for Python by Christophe Carvenius (https://www.sumsar.net/blog/2017/02/introduction-to-bayesian-data-analysis-part-one/):

Swedish Fish Incorporated, a leading Swedish mail-order fish company, is exploring the Danish market with one-year salmon subscriptions. They tested a marketing strategy, "Method A," which involves sending out colorful brochures to encourage sign-ups. After sending 16 brochures, six Danes subscribed. Marketing suggests telemarketing would achieve a 20% sign-up rate, though the source of this exact figure is unclear.
How likely is Method A to outperform telemarketing in getting salmon subscriptions?
What's the expected number of sign-ups if 500 people receive brochures from Method A? 
Compare Method A with Method B, considering the CEO's expectation of a 5-15% subscription rate.
Examine the cost and profit comparison between Method A and B through their posterior distributions. (Costs could be determened by us)
