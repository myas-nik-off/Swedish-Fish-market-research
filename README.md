# Swedish-Fish-market-research

Problem by Rasmus Bååth (adapted for Python by Christophe Carvenius):

Swedish Fish Incorporated, a leading Swedish mail-order fish company, is exploring the Danish market with one-year salmon subscriptions. They tested a marketing strategy, "Method A," which involves sending out colorful brochures to encourage sign-ups. After sending 16 brochures, six Danes subscribed. The company now wants to assess the effectiveness of Method A.
How likely is Method A to outperform telemarketing in getting salmon subscriptions? Marketing suggests telemarketing would achieve a 20% sign-up rate, though the source of this exact figure is unclear. What's the chance that Method A secures more sign-ups than telemarketing? What's the expected number of sign-ups if 500 people receive brochures from Method A? Compare Method A to Method B and use a prior informed by the CEO's perspective. Examine the cost and profit comparison between Method A and B through their posterior distributions.
